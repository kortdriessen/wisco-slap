# SLAP-MI-2 SLEEP (aka wisco-slap)
-------------------------------------------------
Specific pipelines for SLAP2 data analysis at the University of Wisconsin - Madison's Center for Sleep and Consciousness.

These pipelines are all likely specific in some way to our lab's particular setup, etc., but in combination with the more general slap2-py package, much of this may be generally useful for anyone performing analysis of SLAP2 data in python, especially if working with outputs from MATLAB after doing preprocessing, etc.
